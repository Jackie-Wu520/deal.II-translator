 [2.x.0]  @defgroup TrilinosWrappers TrilinosWrappers The classes in this module are wrappers around functionality provided by the Trilinos library. They provide a modern object-oriented interface that is compatible with the interfaces of the other linear algebra classes in deal.II. All classes and functions in this group reside in a namespace  [2.x.1]  These classes are only available if a Trilinos installation was detected during configuration of deal.II. Refer to the README file for more details about this. @author Martin Kronbichler, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2008 @ingroup LAC   [2.x.2]
