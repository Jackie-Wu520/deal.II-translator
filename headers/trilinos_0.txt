 [2.x.0]   @defgroup TrilinosWrappers TrilinosWrappers 

 The classes in this module are wrappers around functionality  provided by the Trilinos library. They provide a modern  object-oriented interface that is compatible with the interfaces of  the other linear algebra classes in deal.II. All classes and  functions in this group reside in a namespace  [2.x.1]  

 These classes are only available if a Trilinos installation was  detected during configuration of deal.II. Refer to the README file  for more details about this.
