 [2.x.0]  @defgroup VMemory Vector memory management This module groups a few classes that are used to avoid allocating and deallocating vectors over and over in iterative procedures. These methods all use an object of the base class VectorMemory to get their auxiliary vectors. Some discussion on this topic can be found in the discussion of the InverseMatrix class in  [2.x.1] . @ingroup LAC   [2.x.2]
