 [2.x.0]   @defgroup VMemory Vector memory management 

 This module groups a few classes that are used to avoid allocating and  deallocating vectors over and over in iterative procedures. These methods  all use an object of the base class VectorMemory to get their auxiliary  vectors. 

 Some discussion on this topic can be found in the discussion of the  InverseMatrix class in  [2.x.1] .
