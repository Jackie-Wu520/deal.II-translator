 [2.x.0]   @defgroup simplex Simplex support (experimental) 

 @brief This module describes the experimental simplex support in deal.II. 

 @section simplex_reference_cells Reference cells 

 In 2D, we provide triangles and quadrilaterals with the following possible  orientations in 3D: 

  [2.x.1]        [2.x.2]     </div>     [2.x.3]        [2.x.4]     </div>  </div> 

 In 3D, tetrahedra, pyramids, wedges, and hexahedra are available: 

    [2.x.5]        [2.x.6]     </div> 

    [2.x.7]        [2.x.8]     </div> 

    [2.x.9]        [2.x.10]     </div> 

    [2.x.11]        [2.x.12]     </div> 

 Each surface of a 3D reference cell consists of 2D reference cells. The  documentation of the enumeration of the numbering of their vertices and  lines are given in the right columns.
