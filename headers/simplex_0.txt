 [2.x.0]  @defgroup simplex Simplex support (experimental) @brief This module describes the experimental simplex support in deal.II. @section simplex_reference_cells Reference cells In 2D, we provide triangles and quadrilaterals with the following possible orientations in 3D:  [2.x.1]  In 3D, tetrahedra, pyramids, wedges, and hexahedra are available:    [2.x.2]       [2.x.3]    </div>    [2.x.4]       [2.x.5]    </div>    [2.x.6]       [2.x.7]    </div>    [2.x.8]       [2.x.9]    </div> Each surface of a 3D reference cell consists of 2D reference cells. The documentation of the enumeration of the numbering of their vertices and lines are given in the right columns.   [2.x.10]
