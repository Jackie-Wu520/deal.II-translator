 [2.x.0]  @defgroup Polynomials Polynomials and polynomial spaces This module groups classes that define certain families of polynomial functions. In particular, this includes Lagrangian interpolation polynomials for equidistant support points and their tensor products in higher dimensions, but also more exotic ones like Brezzi-Douglas-Marini or Raviart-Thomas spaces.
