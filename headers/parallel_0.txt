 [2.x.0]   @defgroup Parallel Parallel computing 

 @brief A module discussing the use of multiple processors. 

 This module contains information on %parallel computing. It is  subdivided into parts on  [2.x.1]  and on  [2.x.2] . / 


 [2.x.3]   A namespace in which we define classes and algorithms that deal  with running in %parallel on shared memory machines when deal.II is  configured to use multiple threads (see  [2.x.4] ), as well as  running things in %parallel on %distributed memory machines (see   [2.x.5] ).
