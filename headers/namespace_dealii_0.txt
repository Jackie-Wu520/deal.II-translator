 [2.x.0]   This is the namespace in which everything in deal.II is. To avoid prefixing  every class and function call with the namespace name, the  [2.x.1]   therefore have a  [2.x.2]  at the top of the  code. 

 Throughout the documentation, the namespace prefix is suppressed for  brevity. / namespace dealii { }
